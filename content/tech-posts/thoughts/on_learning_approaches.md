title = 'Adapting my learning process'
+++

As I step out of university and into the profesional world,
I noticed that I have been particularly struggling with
learning new material related to my field, both on the job and
during my personal time.

This has been handicapping, as (1) I have access to quite a
large amount of information and training material in my current
position, which I might lose access to sometime down the line,
and (2) I need to establish a healthy learning approach early-on
in my career, to be able to continuously learn in a way that
is compatible with a full-time job and a good work-life balance.

One of the main idea behind this blog was to keep an 'archive'
of learnt technical concepts, as well as concrete examples on
how to apply them in the field.

### The importance of deadlines

The learning process which got me through university is
mostly associated with deadlines. Having a deadline for an
exam or project deliverable was what motivated/pushed me to
learn and practice specific topics to achieve mastery.

This included engineering disciplines, such as maths, physics,
computer engineering..

I was quite a procrastinator during university, leading to
many late nights (and even overnights) which were not the best
for my health at the time, but got the job done.

My focus on doing well on these deliverables/exams was due to the
fear of having grades below average or failing (duh) which (1) would
hurt my chances when applying to masters' programs, and (2) I
thought would dissappoint close family (which in reality did not 
pay much attention to my grades).

The focus on grades didn't necessarily mean I understood the topics
very well, but had enough understanding and practice to get going
and solve typical problems. I didn't focus much in any of the classes
I attended in person, which is probably something I should have addressed back then,
as this led to me not understanding and building intuition within the classroom,
but rather outside of the classroom itself.

These deadlines/exam dates forced me to put in the work and effort,
including re-reading, making sure I understood examples, working
through the examples myself, preparing hand-written/computer notes,
having a cheat sheet of important concepts, practicing on problems
to catch as much 'edge-cases' and particular problems which might
be included in the exam.

Being nervous/late on studying for a particular topic, I had a
tendancy to brute-force studying without really understanding what
I was really doing or solving. This led to some pretty underwhelming
results, where I did badly on these exams even though I spent quite
a lot of time studying.

Brute-forcing practice without really understanding has brought me
limited success and a lot of pain and anxiety. This includes both
my time in university and currently during my professional career.


The best exam scores I had were due to a studying process where (1)
there were available test banks I could extensively train on and which
reflect quite well the contents of the exam, (2) I was quite comfortable
with the material and actually built intuition/understood problem solving
quite well. There was usually in overlap between subjects were I did well,
and subjects I tutored to other people while providing my own examples and
material. 

I think that mastering a topic comes through a balance of (1) building
intuition around the topic and the rules which apply, (2) putting
in the work to solve problems or live examples, and memorizing
key concepts which need to be recalled on the spot during problem
solving.

For my professional career, I think it would be best to build intuition
and learn about basic concepts, build necessary tools to automate repetitive
tasks all while understanding what these tools do under the hood (especially
if they end up failing and require fixing), and be able to explain back
in details using my own words and the appropriate technical terminology
when asked. 

Working/studying with other people got me through some tough times.
Having someone explain concepts to me, and then having me repeat them
or solve related exercises what quite helpful to burn understanding
of certain topics in my mind. Also, I really appreciated teaching back
topics/tutoring other classmates when needed. Topics end up being a lot
more clearer when you need to explain them back to someone in your own words.

I did some tutoring, both free and paid during my time in university.
This included tutoring SAT Math subjects and introduction to computer
programming courses.


### Engaging responsability towards someone/some entity

Who am I learning for ? Can we quantify the value derived ? 

Studying with the only motivation to get high grades was a key part
of my relative success during my education. However, finding purpose
and drive in tutoring other students was also quite important.

If someone was struggling when doing honest efforts to learn about a topic
I knew well, or they were just good friends studying last minute, I found
it enjoyable to tutor them about this same topic and found I benefited from
this tutoring by coming out with a better understanding of the topic myself.
I would sometime collect or prepare from scratch additional material
related to the subject to make sure that classmates would understood well
and there was no ambiguity concerning the topic.

It's incredible how certain comments can stick with you after such a long time.

Finding a similar purpose where learning outside of a university environment
is quite difficult. I miss the feeling of having a 'promotion' or other
classmates going through the same struggle as I am, with the same courses,
the same exams and deadlines. This lack of camaraderie when studying in
the professional world is affecting my drive to study quite a lot.

I wish to find communities or other people studying the same topics as me,
so I can rekindle this feeling of working towards a common/individual goal
with other peers.

Concerning my own learning, I could write down technical blogs satisfying a
certain standard of quality so that they could be read/consumed by anyone
who'd stumble upon them online. If I work on a very niche or specific topic
it could be quite useful to some people, and frankly I would find it quite
fulfilling for my drive to learn if it results in active knowledge
that it is helping other people in their work or personal learning journey.
These people also include future-me, who'd stumble into these archived posts
when attempting to review/re-learn a specific topic.

Maybe I could do some youtube videos, which would be quite short in length,
and whose objective is to explain concepts as concisely as possible using
appropriate visualizations.

### Learning on the job vs outside the job

Drawing the line here is quite difficult for me. There is dev/operational work
which needs to be done during work hours, leaving very brief periods of time
to dedicate to learning. When I attempt to learn during my free time,
the idea that I should not be working outside of work kicks-in, and even
if I have some motivation to work, the topics I am currently following
do not greatly interest me (or I did not find a proper way to make them
interesting yet).

Ideally, I'd dedicate a slot during work hours for learning topics related
to my day-to-day work.

On interesting challenge with learning on the job is that some of the resources
which need to be learned are internal to the company, and therefore I cannot
use existing techniques to write down notes and share knowledge to a wider
audience. This leads to another interesting dynamic, where the main approach
to share knowledge and get feedback is either through internal documentation
pages or through brown bag sessions.

Whatever approach I decide to take, the discipline I adopt during the learning
process will be crucial to see any success.

### Taking notes, memorization, visualizing concepts and their relationships

I've been taking notes using markdown for quite a while, with software such as
vscode, Typora, Obsidian.

It is still a work in progress, but I think I should develop additional methods
to structure learnt information, and more particularly visualize this information
or relationship between different sections of a particular topics.

I am still unsure of which tools to use for easy-to-design visualizations,
maybe Mermaid.js, diagram.net or else.

Some other ideas include having a glossary, taking daily notes

I really, really dislike math formulas and especially math formulas generated
using Latex. Latex is pretty good, and I've used it myself for reports,
documents and even CVs. However, past trauma from university math courses
still linger and is triggered whenever I see a dreaded math formulae.

### To what extent should I practice new concepts to be satisfied ?

Learning outside of a school setting means there are no exams, no set deadlines.
There is an added responsability where the boundaries of our learning need
to be set independently and responsibly.

No exam questions or test banks are there to set a benchmark for practice.
Memorization is also not actively considered as all this information is available
freely on the web, although not considering memorization can hurt overall building
of intuition and relating topics to each other, as well as remembering certain
concepts on the spot.

Building and maintaining a web of knowledge requires that each information is
treated with proper respect and practice. There should be not ambiguity due to
the apparent usefulness of an information over another, or futile attempt
at 'maximizing' usefulness of information learnt.

I have to accept that as a software engineering professional, I will learn
all throughout my technical career and it will never stop. There
needs to be a degree of acceptance that I will never know everything, even
about my particular sub-field I claim expertise in. What makes me valuable
are the experience and scars I've collected from building, maintaining,
and debugging different types of large scale systems.
